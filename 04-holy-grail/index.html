          <h1>1990's was cool</h1>
          <img alt="90's style" src="90s_style.jpeg">
          <p>Culturally, the 1990s are characterized by the rise of multiculturalism and
          alternative media, which continued into the 2000s. Movements such as grunge, the rave
          scene and hip hop spread around the world to young people during that decade, aided by
          then-new technology such as cable television and the World Wide Web.</p>

          <p>In the absence of world communism which collapsed in the first two years of the decade
          the 1990s was politically defined by a movement towards the right-wing, including
          increase in support for far-right parties in Europe[1] as well as the advent of the Hindu
          nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party[2] and cuts in social spending in the United
          States,[3] Canada,[4] New Zealand,[5] and the UK.[6] The United States also saw a massive
          revival in the use of the death penalty in the 1990s, which reversed in the early 21st
          century.[7] During the 1990s the character of the European Union and Euro were formed and
          codified in treaties.</p>

          <p>A combination of factors, including the continued mass mobilization of capital markets
          through neo-liberalism, the thawing of the decades-long Cold War, the beginning of the
          widespread proliferation of new media such as the Internet from the middle of the decade
          onwards, increasing skepticism towards government, and the dissolution of the Soviet
          Union led to a realignment and reconsolidation of economic and political power across the
          world and within countries. The dot-com bubble of 1997â€“2000 brought wealth to some
          entrepreneurs before its crash between 2000 and 2001.</p>

          <p>The 1990s saw extreme advances in technology, with the World Wide Web, the first gene
          therapy trial, and the first designer babies[8] all emerging in 1990 and being improved
          and built upon throughout the decade.</p>

          <p>New ethnic conflicts emerged in Africa, the Balkans, and the Caucasus, the former two
          which led to the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides, respectively. Signs of any resolution of
          tensions between Israel and the Arab world remained elusive despite the progress of the
          Oslo Accords, though The Troubles in Northern Ireland came to a standstill in 1998 with
          the Good Friday Agreement after 30 years of violence.</p>
